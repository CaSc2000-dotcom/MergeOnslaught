# Overview

This project is a unique game developed using the Godot game engine, blending elements from Vampire Survivors and the classic puzzle game 2048. The gameplay is split into two main sections: on the left, players face waves of enemies in a survival-style arena, while on the right, they play a 4x4 grid-based 2048 puzzle. Successfully merging tiles in the puzzle grants power-ups, which can be used to gain advantages against the enemies. The game will feature an inventory system for managing collected power-ups and items, and a leaderboard to track high scores. Development will utilize either GDScript or C++ (via GDExtension) based on compatibility with Godot 4.0 and ease of use.
